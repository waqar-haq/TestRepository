AudioSnag
=========
AudioSnag tasks - please fix the following:

-- Regarding the translation, a friend recommended the Google app API because its free. Can you send a quote for adding that? Thanks. 
-- home screen button does not redirect to home screen. DONE (Arslan)
-- when I recorded audio and tried to clear it to record a new file, the clear button did not clear the audio or reset recording time. 
-- Also, this "Clear Audio" button should be prompted after the recording is done
when you record and transcribe, i like having the different options but when you select the text that is most accurate it does not take you to the transcription screen
-- when sharing file via email or text, the text is sent but not the audio file. It should be sent as an attachment. 
-- on the "settings" screen, the auto-transcribe and auto copy to email setting buttons are not working or switching to "on" when clicked on. DONE (Isidoro)
